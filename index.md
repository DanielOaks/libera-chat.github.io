title: Welcome to Libera.Chat
---

We're excited to announce the launch of Libera.Chat, and welcome you to a
next-generation IRC network for free and open source software projects and
similarly-spirited collaborative endeavours.

Most of our staff have joined us from freenode, and we intend to continue
its legacy. It was a privilege to provide the FOSS world with a collaborative
platform.

When freenode announced that it was joining with Private Internet Access in
2017 the domain name was transferred to a holding company with one Andrew Lee
as majority shareholder. Staff were uncertain but assured that PIA was to have
no operational influence.

In early 2021, that changed. New advertising was pushed onto the freenode
website without warning. The head of staff at the time ultimately resigned
rather than explain. In the time since, there have been changes to network
operations for which we have received no explanation.

This was the writing on the wall. As a precautionary measure, we began laying
the groundwork for what would become Libera.Chat. Our legal home is a
non-profit association in Sweden, with all our staff holding equal stakes,
and we will never accept corporate control.

This evening control of freenode's cheese warehouse, biscuit silo and wine
tanks were transferred to freenode Limited and its agents. We don't know these
people, and we cannot in good conscience entrust you or your data to them.

Together we have built and participated in great communities with IRC, and
hope to continue that journey with you on Libera.Chat. We have courageous
ambitions for the future of IRC and the communities that we cherish.
Please join us on this adventure.
