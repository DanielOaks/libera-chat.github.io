**COMING SOON**&mdash;Libera Chat, a next-generation IRC projects
collaboration!

## Who?

Libera Chat is a Swedish non-profit organisation created to provide a
community platform for free and open-source software and peer directed projects
on a volunteer basis.

## How?

The new IRC network is being built up as we speak; more details will follow
here shortly.

## What will the new network be like?

We will be building from the start as a democratically run non-profit whose
aims will be to further the interests of FOSS projects.

## How can I help?

We'd appreciate help from people with graphics design and branding talents,
as well as sponsors willing to provide servers for running IRCd nodes.
